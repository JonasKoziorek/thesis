The field of dynamical systems is a modern branch of mathematics that studies complex systems.
It's main goal is to understand the long term behavior of systems that evolve in time.
Real-world models from physics, biology, engineering as well as purely theoretical models are being studies.
Subfields such as chaos theory and fractals are part of this field that caught a lot of attention from the general public.
The buzzword "butterfly effect" coined by Edward Lorenz, famous for the Lorenz attractor \cite{Lorenz2004}, has been used in many movies and books.

Dynamical systems are difficult to study analytically.
Many algorithms are being developed to detect and measure various properties and to control and predict the behavior of dynamical systems.
Our initial aim was to study the phenomena called intermittency.
Intermittency is a characteristics of a system during which system alternates between seemingly predictable and chaotic behavior.
Since there is numerous types of intermittency, we decided to focus on the type-I intermittency.
We have realized that type-I intermittency leads to ambiguity of a bifurcation diagram, a tool commonly used for global analysis of a system.
Hence enhancing bifurcation diagram with warning about underlying type-I intermittency could be a useful tool for scientists and engineers.
