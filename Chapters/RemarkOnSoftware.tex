\chapter{Remark On Software}
\label{sec:software_remark}

This chapter addresss software used by the author for conducting numerical experiments and generating figures presented in this work.
Furthermore, we compare our choice of software with other currently popular alternatives.
Finally, commentary is provided on the code written by the author.

\section{Used Software}
Numerical simulations play a crucial role in the field of dynamical systems, given the inherent limitations in our capacity to solve problems analitically.
Oftentimes it is needed to solve differential equations numerically or iterate discrete dynamical systems for thousands of iterations.
Such tasks aren't solvable by hand.
As in every other technical field, dealing with data and representing them using suitable graphical representation is a neccessesity of every scientist.
In light of these considerations, it is necessary to use suitable software for each task.
