\chapter{Conclusion}

The aim of this thesis was to develop an alorithm for automatic detection of type-I intermittency.
In the first chaper the theory of discrete dynamical systems and type-I intermittency is introduced.
Subsequently importance of detection of type-I intermittency is presented and consequences of its neglection is discussed.
