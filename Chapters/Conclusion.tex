\chapter{Conclusion}

The aim of this thesis was to develop an alorithm for automatic detection of type-I intermittency.
In the first chaper we have introduced the theory of discrete dynamical systems, logistic map, and type-I intermittency.
Subsequently we have explained why it is important to detect type-I intermittency and what are the issues if we don't.
