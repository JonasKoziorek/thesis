# Topic

Study of dynamical systems using the Julia programming language

# Description 

The phenomena of dynamical systems has attracted researchers from various scientific fields for the past decades.
One of the most important parts of the mathematical theory of dynamical systems is focused on the detection of the properties of dynamical systems.
For this purpose, mathematical and also algorithmic approach is developed to detect system’s complexity.
The main aim of this thesis is to study dynamical properties of suitable mathematical models using the Julia programming language.

# Aim

1. to study and define all needed notions, 
2. to construct typical models from the dynamical systems theory, 
3. to characterize investigated model’s dynamical behavior, 
4. to investigate non-trivial dynamical phenomena, e.g. intermittencies"
